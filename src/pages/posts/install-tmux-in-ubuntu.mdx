## Install tmux in Ubuntu
To install tmux in ubuntu, open your terminal and run:
```bash
sudo apt install tmux
```
And that'll install tmux! Pretty easy right? But wait.. there's more..

## Set escape-time to 0 (recommended for vim users)
If you use Vim, like me, you'll also need to set escape-time to 0 in ~/.tmux.conf file. If that file doesn't already exist you'll have to create by running:
```bash
vim ~/.tmux.conf
```
Now in this file add this line:
```
set -sg escape-time 0
```

If you don't set this option, in Vim when you press Esc you'll notice a delay, which as you can imagine is annoying as hell for vim users.
