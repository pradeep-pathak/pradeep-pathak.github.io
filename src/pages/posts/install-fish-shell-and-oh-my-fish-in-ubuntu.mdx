TODO: write an introduction

## Install Fish Shell
To install latest Fish shell on ubuntu, open the terminal and run:
```bash
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:fish-shell/release-3
sudo apt update
sudo apt install fish
```
And That's all you need to do to install fish shell. But wait, there's more..

## Make Fish shell your default shell
In a terminal run:
```bash
chsh -s $(which fish)
```
to make fish shell default shell for your user.

## Install Oh My Fish (recommended)
With fish shell you'd also want to install Oh My Fish, which is just as easy to install:
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish/master/bin/install | fish
```

After installing Oh My Fish you can now install a theme for your fish shell. For example if you want to install agnoster, you can install that by running:
```bash
omf install agnoster
```

## Add some configuration (optional)
~/.config/fish/config.fish is the Fish shell's equivalent of ~/.bashrc. This is how my config.fish looks like:
```fish
set -g -x fish_greeting ''

alias la 'ls -A'
alias cd.. 'cd ..'
alias c 'clear'
alias v. 'vim .'
alias nvim. 'nvim .'
alias code. 'code . --disable-gpu && exit'

xset r rate 200 39
```
